                You will be asked to enter through the front door and exit

                child. Siblings will be able to arrive at the same time. You may
                be asked to wait to enter the building if there are too many

                Upon arrival your child's temperature will be taken with an

                degrees celsius we will ask you to wait to the side for 5
                minutes and we will take the temperature again. If your child's
                temperature remains above 38 degrees after this we will ask you

              During the day of camp

            <ul class="weekly">
              <li>
                In order to protect children and staff, we are utilizing
                multiple measures to maximize health and safety at camp during a
                typical day:
              </li>
              <li>
                If an instructor is working with a beginner biker and close
                contact/support is required, PPE has been identified by health
                officials as suitable mitigation for this situation. This is a
                similar approach being used by barbers, hairstylists and any
                other personal service that requires close proximity between
                worker and customer. Also note that instructors are advised to
                limit physical contact with children and support the bike as
                opposed to the child wherever possible. Instructors and children
                should always wear their bike gloves.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our staff all have first aid training and will use their best
                judgement to balance the need for wound treatment and emotional
                support, with the need to limit close contact. If needed we will
                call 911 or refer to the non emergency line.
              </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <div class="covid-box" data-speed = "4">
              <ul class="weekly">
                <li>
                  Campers stay together in their smaller classes for the day
                  with the same instructor where possible and a tail gunner
                  where possible to help promote social distancing and we will
                  stay outside when possible to give children room to keep their
                  distance from each other. Small group sizes, ideally with
                  children who already know or play with each other, can help
                  reduce the likelihood of virus transmission if children are
                  placed into groups within their own social networks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Classes will be distanced between each other and will mostly
                  be riding trails based south of the village as we are more
                  easily able to promote social distancing on the trails.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If it becomes too difficult to manage physical distancing
                  measures with any children, coaches will immediately stop the
                  activity and focus on keeping the children safe and at least
                  6ft (2m) apart. We will take regular breaks; tired children
                  tend to forget rules and stop listening!

                  games and drills, making it part of the fun to learn about how
                  and why children need to respect each other’s space, during
